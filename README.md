**I am a graphic design professional with years of print design experience and a budding web design career.**
I am exceptional at transforming ideas and concepts into award-winning designs. My long-time newspaper career honed my ability to create quality designs on deadline, to perform in a team environment or independently, to triple-check visual as well as written work, and to tackle special or long-term projects. My journalism degree trained me in reporting, photography and copy-editing.
